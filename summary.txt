1. **GitHub Actions Workflow (YAML):** This is a configuration for a GitHub Actions workflow. 
It's triggered on every push to the 'main' branch. The workflow runs on the latest version of Ubuntu 
and has several steps including checking out the repository code, configuring AWS credentials, 
setting up Terraform, initializing Terraform, generating a Terraform plan, and applying the Terraform 
plan. The workflow uses the AWS credentials stored in GitHub secrets and the Terraform version is set
 to `1.1.7`. The `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands use a variable file located at
  `environments/dev/lambda_all.tfvars`.

2. **Lambda Function Configurations (HCL):** This is a list of configurations for AWS Lambda functions. 
Each configuration includes the function name, handler, runtime, timeout, environment variables, and the 
S3 bucket and key for the function's deployment package. The configurations are stored in a Terraform
 variable file.

3. **Terraform Variables (HCL):** These are the declarations for the Terraform variables `region`,
 `environment`, and `lambda_functions`. The `region` variable specifies the AWS region for deployment. 
 The `environment` variable specifies the environment (like dev, test, prod) for deployment. 
 The `lambda_functions` variable is a list of configurations for each Lambda function to be deployed.

4. **Terraform Resources (HCL):** These are the declarations for the Terraform resources 
`aws_lambda_function` and `aws_iam_role`. The `aws_lambda_function` resource block creates 
multiple AWS Lambda functions based on the provided configurations in `var.lambda_functions`.
 The `aws_iam_role` resource block creates an IAM role for each Lambda function. The IAM role
  allows the Lambda function to assume the role and perform actions on AWS resources.

5. **Terraform Backend and Provider Configuration (HCL):** This block configures the backend for
 Terraform state files and the AWS provider. The state files are stored in an S3 bucket. The AWS
  provider is configured with the region specified in the `var.region` variable.

6. **Terraform Module (HCL):** This block calls a module to create AWS Lambda functions.
 The module is located at `./modules/lambdas`. It passes the environment, region, and a list of Lambda 
 function configurations to the module.

In summary, this code sets up a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys AWS Lambda functions using 
Terraform whenever there's a push to the `main` branch. The Lambda functions are configured in a 
Terraform variable file and are created in the specified AWS region and environment. 
The state of the Terraform deployment is stored in an S3 bucket. This approach allows you to manage 
different environments with different settings by using different variable files.
